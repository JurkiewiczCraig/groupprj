# Technical Leg for Group Project, Week 11
1) Started up ArcGIS Pro and added in data from the map through the ArcGIS online Portal onto the map.

2) Started clipping the data to focus on several urban cities, santa clarita, Austin texas and San Francisco to narrow in on for our study.  Highlighted several small cities individually then ran the "clip" geoprocessing tool.
3) From the  "Share" Ribbon, click on "Publish as Web Layer", from there add in the names of each of the cities, publish type of a feature layer and choose the location as "GEOM99GRPPRJ" to uplaod the data onto 
4) Open up maps in AGOL and add in the clipped layers (at this point the layers were not loading, switched gears into working in AGOL only from here)

5) opened up AGOL, loaded "Maps" and added the layer "EPA Walkability Index" ID e09a600e67654f5093f7ece6d8c3feab.  All maps mentioned in the technical log will be based off of this map and data
   
6) Started creating web maps for the 4 parameters used when calculating the walkability index (Looked at several different urban cities, one for each of the factors) with dark grey canvas and light blue symbology.  The four maps created showed off Intersection Density (D3b),  Proximity to Transit Stops(D4a),Emplyment Mix(D2b_E8MixA ) and  employment and household income(D2a_EpHHm).  

7)After speaking with Tyler Rubini, we decided to follow his outline of following one distinct city for rural factors and another for urban factors Created a copy of Tyler Rubini's Walkability Storymap to add my webmaps on to 

8) Centered all the previous maps on Austin Texas before adding them to the storymap

9)Changed the settings on Tyler's copy to allow for navigation, Each Haading1 will now be considered it's own"chapter" to help users move through the storymap a bit easier.

10) created copies of the maps that Tyler worked on and edited them to follow suit with the style of maps that I had created so there was a bit more cohesion between them all

11)Created another "Chapter" of other relationships to be explored wtihin the data, and added in tylers relationships that he had explored

12) looked into greenhouse gas emissions vs walkability index, added in a button (clicking the + button on the left hand side, is listed under "Basic") so users can jump between Austin and Joplin

13)  Click "+ Add" and click "Swipe" to add in a swipe ability.  Created a web map of Zero Car Households to compare walkability index of Austin texas.  Users can click on the swipe button in the middle of the maps and see how they compare/contrast to each other
