# Technical Leg for Group Project, Week 11


1) opened up AGOL, loaded "Maps" and added the layer "EPA Walkability Index" ID e09a600e67654f5093f7ece6d8c3feab.  All maps mentioned in the technical log will be based off of this map and data
   
2) Started creating web maps for the 4 parameters used when calculating the walkability index (Looked at several different urban cities, one for each of the factors) with dark grey canvas and light blue symbology.  The four maps created showed off Intersection Density (D3b),  Proximity to Transit Stops(D4a),Emplyment Mix(D2b_E8MixA ) and  employment and household income(D2a_EpHHm).  

3)After speaking with Tyler Rubini, we decided to follow his outline of following one distinct city for rural factors and another for urban factors Created a copy of Tyler Rubini's Walkability Storymap to add my webmaps on to 

4) Centered all the previous maps on Austin Texas before adding them to the storymap

5)Changed the settings on Tyler's copy to allow for navigation, Each Haading1 will now be considered it's own"chapter" to help users move through the storymap a bit easier.

6) created copies of the maps that Tyler worked on and edited them to follow suit with the style of maps that I had created so there was a bit more cohesion between them all

7)Created another "Chapter" of other relationships to be explored wtihin the data, and added in tylers relationships that he had explored

8) looked into greenhouse gas emissions vs walkability index, added in a button (clicking the + button on the left hand side, is listed under "Basic") so users can jump between Austin and Joplin

9)  Click "+ Add" and click "Swipe" to add in a swipe ability.  Created a web map of Zero Car Households to compare walkability index of Austin texas.  Users can click on the swipe button in the middle of the maps and see how they compare/contrast to each other
