2)After speaking with Tyler Rubini, we decided to follow his outline of following one distinct city for rural factors and another for urban factors Created a copy of Tyler Rubini's Walkability Storymap to add my webmaps on to 
3)Changed the settings on Tyler's copy to allow for navigation, Each HEading1 will now be considered it's own"chapter" to help users move through the storymap
4) created copies of the maps that Tyler worked on and edited them to follow suit with the style of maps that I had created so there was a bit more cohesion between them all
5) Looked into possible correlations/interesting factors to compare and contrast with the data that was provided
6)added a button so users could move between Austin Texas and Joplin Missouri to see comparisons between the two, as well as a swwipe so users could get side by side comparisons of austin texas for certain factors and criteria
